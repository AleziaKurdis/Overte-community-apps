Welcome to the "Project Athena" Applications Repository.

This repository stores the optional tablet's applications/functionalities provided by the contributions of the community members. 

If you have created an Application and want to offer it to the community, this is where you can do it.

Before going further:
1- If your applications is a core feature that you think that must be delivered out-of-the-box with Athena, you must instead consider to make your contribution directly in the "Project Athena" release. See instead this repository [link] and contact their maintainers.

2- If your application has any dependancy with an external server or services. (If it has to deal in any ways with another servers than a Project Athena Domain or Metaverse API) This repository is not where you should publish your application. It will have to be publish from a different source like the marketplace or another web site.
